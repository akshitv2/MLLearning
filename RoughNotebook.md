1. Central Limit Theorem
	- As sample size increases, sampling distribution of the mean tends to become normally distributed regardless of shape of population dist.
	- When sample is large (usually n>=30)
	- Sampling distribution should approximate normality to be valid

2. Standard Error
	$$\text{SE} = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$$
	- Standard deviation of sampling dist
	- Measures how much sample mean is expected to vary from sample to sample.
	- Decreases as n increases

3. Law of large numbers
	- As number of observations increase sample mean converges with true population mean

4. Sample size determination
	- For Population Mean
			$$n = \left( \frac{E}{Z \cdot \sigma} \right)^2$$
		- 𝑛 = required sample size
		- 𝑍 = Z-score corresponding to the confidence level (e.g., 1.96 for 95%)
		- 𝜎 = population standard deviation (estimate if unknown)
		- 𝐸 = desired margin of error
	- For Population Proportion
		$$n = \frac{Z^2 \cdot p \cdot (1 - p)}{E^2}$$
		- Z = z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level
		- 𝑝 = estimated population proportion
		- 𝐸 = margin of error (in decimal form, e.g., 0.05 for 5%)

5. Margin of Error (E)
	- Range within which true population parameter is expected to lie with level of confidence.
